# TrendFlix Test App
## This app is intended as a technical test for TT Education
 

This project is a fictional movies and tv shows guide displaying the latest flix available from the TMDB online. It allows users to browse a simple homepage module with the latest TV Shows and also allows users to search movies and shows by genre and year of release.

### Initial Considerations

* This project requires Axios to be installed
* The node_modules folder has been left in the repo for convenience
* The UI/UX Design can be dramatically improved but considering the short notice for delivery of the project and limited brief, I have focused on functionality over design
* Optional features fell outside my available time frame due to current work resposibilities that were unavoidable and took some of my time in the last 24 hours

### Intended Usage

* Clone repo locally
* Run npm start
* Browse the site in your local server
